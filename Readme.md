## Description
This project was done as the semestral project for the Digital Images Processing subject, at Computer Engineering in UTFPR, campus Toledo Paran√°. 
The objective is to produce a database of kitchen utensils, creating then more images through filters and equalization, in order to produce a classifier (in this project, KNN). The results were surprisingly low, but acquiring knowledge was the main goal.
